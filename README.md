# redditswapbot

## Description

Scripts that are used on /r/mechmarket and /r/hardwareswap created by the mods of /r/hardwareswap and modified for use by /u/chankster, /u/NotMelNoGuitars, and /u/thelectronicnub. There are three currently running instances of the bot, /u/hwsbot, /u/mechkbot, /u/funkoswapbot.  Finally updated to support Praw v5.

## Files

* **flair.py**
  * Watches the current confirmed trade post (specified in config.cfg) and updates user flair.
  * Normally fired via cronjob.
  * Accepts -m (curr,prev) to allow for processing of the previous month.
  * Checks flairs against a database and will warn if the flair deviates more than the value in the config.  Helps to catch users that accidently hide flair and end up getting reset
  * Easier manual flair processing.  Simply send the bot a message with the URL of the root comment in the body (click permalink first).  The bot will flair the users, delete the warning message, approve the reported comment, reply with 'added', and send a confirming PM to the mod.
